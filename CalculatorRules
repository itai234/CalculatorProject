    Instructions:
    - Enter mathematical equations in standard notation for example - (3 + 4 * 2 / (1 - 5) ^ 2).
    - Write 'EXIT' to close the calculator.
    - My Calculator Supports :  unary negatives, and parentheses and more.
    Operators in my Calculator:
    + Will sum two Operands: 5+5 ğŸŸ° 10 , 10+5 ğŸŸ° 15
    - Will subtract one operand from the other: 5-5 ğŸŸ° 0 , 10-5 ğŸŸ° 5
    * Will multiply two Operands: 5*2 ğŸŸ° 10
    / Will divide two Operands: 5/2 ğŸŸ° 2.5 , 5/0 ğŸŸ° X (division by zero)
    ^ Will give the power of the first operand by the other: 5^2 ğŸŸ° 25 , 100^0.5 ğŸŸ° 10
    % Will give the modulo of one operand from the other: 5%3 ğŸŸ° 2, 5%0 ğŸŸ° X(cant give modulo of a negative value)
    $ Will give the maximum value of two Operands: 5$0 ğŸŸ° 5 , 123$9 ğŸŸ° 123
    & Will give the minimum value of two Operands: 5&0 ğŸŸ° 0 , 123&9 ğŸŸ° 9
    @ Will give the avg of two Operands: 5@2 ğŸŸ° 3.5
    ~ Will give the negative value of a operand: ~3 ğŸŸ° -3 , ~~3 ğŸŸ° X (wont work double tilda) , ~-3 ğŸŸ° 3
    ! Will give the factorial of a Operand: 3! --> 3*2*1 ğŸŸ° 6 , (-3)! ğŸŸ° X (only for positive numbers) , 3!! ğŸŸ° (3*2*1)! ğŸŸ° 720"
    # Will sum the digits of a Operand : 2.3# ğŸŸ°  5 , 53# ğŸŸ° 8 , 99## ğŸŸ° 9 (first sum is 18 and then 9
